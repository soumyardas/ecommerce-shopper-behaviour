## [Project Overview](#project-overview)

### [Getting started immediately](#getting-started)

## [Datasets](#datasets)

## [Dependencies](#dependencies)

## [Workflow](#workflow)

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Cloning the repository: 

### 2. **Setting up the environment:**

### 3. Running `notebooks/notebook.ipynb`

### 4. Training model

### 5. Making predictions

### 6. Containerizing the model

### 7. Deploying an AWS Elastic Beanstalk application

#### Details of application:

## [Models](#models)

We evaluated the performances of four different models. Their accuracies and ROC AUC are listed in the table below:

|Model                          | Accuracy 	| ROC_AUC 	|
|-----                          | -------- 	| ------- 	|
|LogisticRegression             | 0.792 	| 0.686 	|
|DecisionTreeClassifier         | 0.793 	| 0.725 	|
|RandomForestClassifier         | 0.793 	| 0.682 	|
|XGBClassifier                  | 0.796 	| 0.749 	|
|LGBMClassifier âœ…              | 0.796   | 0.752   |

Our final model, LGBMClassifier, produced a score of **0.807** and an ROC AUC = **0.797**.

## [Contributions and Feedback](#contributions-and-feedback)

We welcome contributions from the community and feedback from healthcare professionals and data scientists. Together, we can refine our model and enhance its utility in real-world healthcare settings. Feel free to explore the project, contribute, or reach out with any questions or suggestions. Together, we can work towards a healthcare system that is more efficient, patient-centered, and cost-effective.
